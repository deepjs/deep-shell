deep shell should first be used to do asynch shell call.



- use it as a client to test and use distant server
	- CRUD  (also html)
	- launch distant test cases
	- get logs, stats, etc...
	- login/logout ...

- create service/server/vm localy

- administrate deployement (git acl)

- do push (comet)

- load/test localy views, routes, etc. (deep-dom)

- deep-elastic : manage index, backup, etc

- deep-git : manage gits

- etc.






So it should be the best deepjs friend in a console.
